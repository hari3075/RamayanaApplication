      <h4>Dasartha</h4>
      <div className='paragraph'>
    <p>Dasaratha is the emperor of Kosala and Ramaâ€™s father. He has three wives, Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumithra, none of whom have children, but after offering specific sacrifices, he has four sons: Rama, Lakshmana, Sathrugna, and Bharatha. Dasaratha cares deeply for all four of his children and resists Viswamithra's request to take Rama on a journey to protect him. However, Dasaratha is extremely dutiful, and finally agrees to Viswamithra's wishes. Later, when Dasaratha realizes that he's getting quite old and should pick a successor, he chooses Rama to succeed him. When Kaikeyi insists that Dasaratha crown her son Bharatha instead of Rama to fulfill a boon he granted her years ago, Dasaratha feels he has no choice but to agree, though agreeing to this leads to Dasaratha's death.</p>
